#we have situation like hammad is eligible to go to school?
#let's makke the program

#integers functions and logical operators
#hammad_age=input("What is hammad age? ")
#age_at_school=5
#hammad_age=int(hammad_age)  #we had to convert it in integer  form becaus age at school type is in integer 
#print(hammad_age==age_at_school)

#solving it in only logical operators
hammad_age=4
age_at_school=5
print(hammad_age==age_at_school)
